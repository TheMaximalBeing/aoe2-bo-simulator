- simulation accuracy
  * update maxCarry upon new tech
  * add instant W chopping for build LC
  * proper animal decay (rather than hacky ratios)
  * chop down trees
  * changing drop-off distances
  * bumping / inefficiencies when too many vills on 1 camp
  * drop-offs
  * properly consider villagers shooting boar (rather than hacky penalties)
  * drop resources before reassignment (rather than add them)
  * delay for luring time

- optimization
  * ensure penalties are accurate
  * ensure drop-off distances are accurate
  * ensure farming gather rates are accurate
  * ensure boar distance is accurate

- boar 0 reassign bug?
- civ bonuses
- team bonusses
- standard techs
- unique techs
- unique buildings
- add fishing ships as gatherers
- add trade carts/trade cogs as gatherers
- add relics as gatherers
- add feitorias as gatherers

- better builder selection
- pull vills from sheep before berries (unless more than 4)
- options to adjust builder selection
- test other build-orders
- test stockpilesPlusCarry against real game data

- add warnings:
  * when run out of natural resources
  * when stockpiles go too negative
  * when housing headroom goes negative
  * when over-foraging
  * when overwatch items blocked due to resources

- generate plots
- make sure we are using the data helpers!!

- recorded data
  * stockpiles + carry
  * housing headroom
  * idle farms
