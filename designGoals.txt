# proper usage of stockpiles
# monitoring
# plots and stats
# update maxCarry upon new tech
# add instant W chopping for build LC
# make sure we are using the data helpers!!

# ======== limitations ========

# no geometry / map locations; we use fixed walking times to simulate reassignment
# no town under attack
# no control of military units
# no villager idle time in general
# villagers don't know what specific object they are targetting (but do know its type)
# assume all resources have a dropsie with a fixed distance (you must manually add enough dropsites to ensure realism)
# assume there is no reassignment between the same resource (assume its all in 1 place)
# farm info is carried by the farmer
# all-farms are force reseeded (need to unassign farmer to prevent it)
# food vills follow a fixed priority order: farms->boar->deer->sheep->fish->forage
# no cramming of villagers (Assume that you distribute them properly)
# 1 builder per building

# ======== goals ========

# ability to predict accurate expected float
# simulate correct gather rates
# simulate different resource types
# simulate reassigning between different resources/town-center
# simulate drop offs
# simulate carry res properly
# simulate limited resources
# simulate 1 vill per farm
# ability to see stockpiles over whole game
# ability to detect if BO is viable
# ability to add whatever we want at a particular time and see the resoures
# ability to enforce limited resources and tech-tree prerequisites when desired (or ignore them)
